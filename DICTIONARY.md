## causal pathway
A process through which an implementation strategy operates to affect desired implementation outcomes.

## cognitive moderator
A moderator that affects the level of influence of an implementation strategy before a mechanism acts on the situation.

## distal outcome
An outcome that an implementation processes is designed to achieve.

## intervention outcome
A process which is a component of a recipient's status after an intervention has been applied that is used to assess the effectiveness of an intervention.
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/cpo#cpo_0000016
## intervention
"A planned process used to influence one or more factors in a research study, and the independent variable in an interventional study wherein the influence is measured or evaluated."

## mechanism
A mediator through which an implemnentation strategy operates to affect desired implementation outcomes.
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/cpo#cpo_0000001
## mediator
An intervening variable that may account for the relationship between the implementation strategy and the implementation outcome.

## moderator
A factor that affects the level of influence of an implementation strategy.

## organism
"A material entity that is an individual living system, such as animal, plant, bacteria or virus, that is capable of replicating or reproducing, growth and maintenance in the right environment. An organism may be unicellular or made up, like humans, of many billions of cells divided into specialized tissues and organs."

## organizational moderator
"A moderator that affects the level of influence of an implementation strategy after, or simultaneously with, a mechanism that acts on the situation."
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/cpo#cpo_0000009
## precondition
A contextual factor that is necessary for a mechanism or implementation outcome to be activated.
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/cpo#cpo_0000002
## proximal outcome
"A product of the implementation strategy that is realized because of its specific mechanism of action, and is the most immediate, observable outcome in the causal pathway."

## recipient role
A role inhering in a Homo sapiens which is realized in the process of receiving feedback during an intervention.
