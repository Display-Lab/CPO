## causal pathway
A process through which an implementation strategy operates to affect desired implementation outcomes.

## cognitive moderator
A moderator that affects the level of influence of an implementation strategy before a mechanism acts on the situation.

## distal outcome
An information content entity that represents the outcome that an implementation processes is designed to achieve.

## intervention
"A planned process used to influence one or more factors in a research study, and the independent variable in an interventional study wherein the influence is measured or evaluated."

## mechanism
A mediator through which an implemnentation strategy operates to affect desired implementation outcomes.
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/cpo_0000001
## mediator
An intervening variable that may account for the relationship between the implementation strategy and the implementation outcome.

## moderator
A generically dependant continuant that affects the level of influence of an implementation strategy.

## organizational moderator
"A moderator that affects the level of influence of an implementation strategy after, or simultaneously with, a mechanism that acts on the situation."
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/cpo_0000009
## precondition
An information content entity that is necessary for a mechanism or implementation outcome to be activated.
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/cpo_0000002
## proximal outcome
"An information content entity that represents the outcome of the implementation strategy that is realized because of its specific mechanism of action, and is the most immediate, observable outcome in the causal pathway."
