## candidate intervention
A plan specification that is designed to change specified behaviour patterns that may be used in an intervention.

## causal pathway
A process through which an implementation strategy operates to affect desired implementation outcomes.

## cognitive moderator
A moderator that affects the level of influence of an implementation strategy before a mechanism acts on the situation.

## distal outcome
An information content entity that represents the outcome that a candidate intervention is designed to achieve.

## mechanism
A mediator through which an implementation strategy operates to affect desired implementation outcomes.
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/cpo_0000001
## mediator
An information content entity that may account for the relationship between the implementation strategy and the implementation outcome.

## moderator
An information content entity that may affect the level of influence of an implementation strategy.

## organizational moderator
"A moderator that affects the level of influence of an implementation strategy after, or simultaneously with, a mechanism that acts on the situation."

## precondition
An information content entity that is necessary for a mechanism or implementation outcome to be activated.
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/cpo_0000002
## proximal outcome
"An information content entity that represents the outcome of the implementation strategy that is realized because of its specific mechanism of action, and is the most immediate, observable outcome in the causal pathway."
